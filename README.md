Developing, Validating and Comparing Prediction Models for Pregnancies of Unknown Location
The analysis focuses on developing risk prediction models for Pregnancies of Unknown location to detect potentially dangerous ectopic pregnancies. 
The goal of developing such risk prediction models is to provide useful decision support tools for implementation in clinical practice.
The dataset includes missing values and has been imputed several times (multiply imputed data). 
Nine different algorithms are applied for binary and multi-class risk prediction models. 
The algorithms include logistic regression, logistic regression with transformations and interaction terms, Ridge regression, Firth logistic regression, 
Classification and Regression Trees, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks.
Internal-external cross-validation (IECV) is used to validate the models. 
The performance of the models is assessed in terms of discrimination, calibration and clinical utility.
